## Internals

### Customizability

You may notice that the [documentation website playground](/playground) is different from the playground used on [Squiggle Hub](/docs/Ecosystem/Hub):
- documentation playground has "Share link" button
- hub playground has "Save" button (if you're logged in and can edit the model)

`<SquigglePlayground />` component provides a way to inject menu items and buttons into the playground.

The [Squiggle linker](/docs/Internal/SqProject#linkers) is also configured differently: documentation playground uses the default linker, which doesn't support imports, while Hub playground supports imports with `hub:username/modelname` syntax.

### Version picker

The playground has a version picker in the top-right corner.

This feature is not built-in; the playground itself doesn't know anything about Squiggle versions, and is only compatible with a single version of Squiggle.

The version picker is implemented with a custom wrapper to the playground, which lazily loads the necessary version of the playground. This is done through the [versioned-components](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/tree/main/internal-packages/versioned-components) package, which depends on **all** versions of Squiggle simultaneously. This `versioned-components` package is not released as a separate npm package yet, but is available in the Squiggle monorepo.

### Usage in React

The playground component is implemented with React.

```tsx
import { SquigglePlayground } from "@quri/squiggle-components";

<SquigglePlayground />
```
