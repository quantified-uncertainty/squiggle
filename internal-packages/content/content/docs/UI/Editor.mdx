title: Squiggle Editor
---

Similar to [Squiggle Playground](./Playground), Squiggle Editor combines the code editor and the real-time viewer of Squiggle outputs. Unlike Squiggle Playground, it uses a vertical layout and has slightly less features.

Most of this documentation uses it instead of the playground, because the vertical layout is more convenient for reading.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`2 to 5`}
/>

## Internals

### Usage in React

The editor component is implemented with React.

```tsx
import { SquiggleEditor } from "@quri/squiggle-components";

<SquiggleEditor />
```
