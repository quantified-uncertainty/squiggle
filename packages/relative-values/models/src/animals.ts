What am I estimating: Impact of corporate commitments that OWA made happen in 2022.

Notes on the estimation: The number of corporate campaigns is from OWA's own reporting. The number of chickens affected and the improvement per chicken is particularly speculative here.

Key simplification: I am using the welfare numbers for meat chickens, rather than for egg-laying chicken. This will give inaccurate results, but hopefully not by many orders of magnitude.
