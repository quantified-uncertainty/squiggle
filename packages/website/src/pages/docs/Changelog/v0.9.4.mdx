## 0.9.4

### [@quri/squiggle-lang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-lang)

Standard library:

- Added `Spec.make` function and `@spec` tag ([#3113](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3113))

- Added the basic `try()` function ([#3137](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3137))

- Added `PointSet.support` function and a new `MixedSet.*` namespace with several functions for working with 1-dimensional sets of points and segments ([#3115](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3115), [#3151](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3151))

- Added `Danger.yTransform` function ([#3127](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3127))

Bugfixes:

- Fixed the issue with very slightly negative KDE values because of floating point errors ([#3114](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3114))

- Fixed parsing of `x = {|...|...} -> ...` statements([#3136](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3136))

Internals:

- Use a custom PRNG (aleaPRNG) and always require seed in environment ([#3006](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3006))

  - Note that this can make some models up to 2x slower, because it's hard to beat the native `Math.random`; but we'll make up for it with other optimizations in future releases

- Variable stack is array-based, with up to 50% better performance in synthetic tests ([#3054](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3054))

- All Squiggle values are serializable ([#3158](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3158))

- Support pluggable runners, including the experimental webworker runner ([#3158](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3158))

- Simplified AST representation ([#3136](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3136))

- Disallow overrides of an internal function responsible for index lookups ([#3135](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3135))

### [@quri/squiggle-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-components)

Features:

- Stable seeds; re-runs of the same model with the same seed will always give the identical result ([#3006](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3006))

- Added Meta+PageUp/PageDown shortcuts to control the current viewer tab ([#3055](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3055))

- Added clickable gutter lines to focus on value variables ([#2980](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/2980))

- Show export data and links in Viewer ([#3056](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3056))

- Support `autorun={false}` prop in `<SquigglePlayground>` component ([#3119](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3119))

Bugfixes:

- Fixed the regression where stacktrace locations weren't clickable

- Recognize `!=` operators during highlighting ([#3133](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3133))

- Fixed the issue with persisting focus and collapse/expand state after errors ([#3129](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3129))

- Render negative values in pointsets correctly ([#3126](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3126))

Experimental:

- Support `Spec` values ([#3113](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3113))

- WebWorker runner ([#3158](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/3158))
