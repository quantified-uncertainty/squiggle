## 1. dmartin89 (submission-dmartin89-1740680874350)

**Final Score**: 7.76/10

### Surprise (40%): 7.67/10

#### Run 1:

To evaluate the surprise factor of this Fermi model for the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider the criteria you've outlined:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: This model does challenge widely held beliefs by framing climate migration as a potential source of innovation and economic value, rather than purely as a burden. This perspective is not commonly discussed in these communities.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The findings are non-obvious, particularly in quantifying the potential innovation dividend of climate migration. The idea that concentrated migration to innovation hubs could be more valuable than even distribution is especially counterintuitive.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model uncovers a previously unrecognized opportunity in the form of increased innovation potential from climate migrants.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The scale of the potential impact - nearly 300,000 additional patents worth approximately $148 billion over 30 years - is significant and likely diverges substantially from common expectations.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The potential for climate migration to generate a substantial "innovation dividend" that could partially offset its costs.
2. The significant per-capita innovation value of $4,582 per migrant, which could justify substantial integration investment.
3. The importance of concentration in innovation hubs rather than even distribution of migrants.
4. The magnitude of the network effects from increased diversity, potentially doubling innovation rates in affected areas.

Given these factors, I would rate the surprise factor of this model as follows:

Surprise Rating: 8/10

This rating is based on:

- The novel framing of climate migration as a potential source of innovation and economic value.
- The quantification of this value, which is likely to be significantly higher than most would intuitively expect.
- The counterintuitive insights about concentration and network effects.
- The potential policy implications, which diverge from common discussions about climate migration.

While the basic idea that migration can drive innovation is not entirely new to these communities, the specific application to climate migration and the scale of the potential impact are likely to be quite surprising. The model provides a new perspective that could significantly shift discussions about climate migration within these communities.

#### Run 2:

To evaluate the surprising nature of this Fermi model's findings for the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider the key aspects you've outlined:

1. Contradiction of Expectations:
   The model challenges the common narrative of climate migration as purely a burden, revealing a potentially significant positive impact on innovation. This contradicts the typical focus on costs and challenges associated with climate migration.

2. Counterintuitiveness:
   The model uncovers several non-obvious insights, particularly the idea that concentrating migrants in innovation hubs could be more valuable than even distribution, and that network effects from increased diversity could nearly double innovation rates.

3. Discovery of Unknowns:
   The model quantifies a previously underexplored aspect of climate migration - its potential to drive innovation. The scale of the innovation dividend (nearly 300,000 additional patents worth approximately $148 billion over 30 years) is a significant discovery.

4. Magnitude of Difference:
   The per-capita innovation value of $4,582 per migrant is substantial and could significantly alter cost-benefit analyses of climate migration policies.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The sheer scale of the potential innovation dividend (300,000 patents, $148 billion)
2. The magnitude of the network effect multiplier (85% boost in innovation)
3. The importance of migrant concentration in innovation hubs
4. The potential for climate migration to partially offset its own costs through innovation

Given these factors, I would rate the surprising nature of this model's findings as an 8 out of 10 for the rationalist and EA communities.

Rationale for the score:

- The model presents a novel and quantified perspective on a well-discussed topic (climate migration)
- It challenges the predominant negative framing of climate migration
- The scale of the potential benefits is large enough to potentially shift policy discussions
- The insights about concentration and network effects are non-obvious and potentially actionable

While the general concept that migration can drive innovation is not entirely new, the specific quantification and application to climate migration, as well as the scale of the potential impact, would likely be quite surprising to most members of these communities.

---

#### Run 3:

To evaluate the surprising nature of this Fermi model for the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider the key aspects you've outlined:

1. Contradiction of Expectations:
   The model challenges the common narrative of climate migration as purely a burden. This perspective shift is likely to be somewhat surprising to these communities, though not entirely novel.

2. Counterintuitiveness:
   The model reveals several non-obvious insights, particularly the potential scale of innovation benefits and the importance of migrant concentration in innovation hubs.

3. Discovery of Unknowns:
   The model uncovers a potentially significant positive externality of climate migration that is often overlooked in policy discussions.

4. Magnitude of Difference:
   The scale of the potential innovation dividend (nearly 300,000 additional patents worth approximately $148 billion over 30 years) is substantial and likely to be surprising in its magnitude.

Specific surprising elements:

1. The per-capita innovation value of $4,582 per migrant is significant and could justify substantial integration investment. This quantification is likely to be novel and surprising.

2. The model suggests that concentrating migrants in innovation hubs could be more valuable than even distribution, which contradicts some common intuitions about migration management.

3. The network effects from increased diversity could nearly double innovation rates in affected areas, which is a larger multiplier than many might expect.

4. The model's approach of quantifying positive externalities of climate migration is itself somewhat novel and surprising in a discourse often dominated by cost-focused analyses.

Rating: 7/10

This rating reflects that while the general concept of positive externalities from migration isn't entirely new to these communities, the specific quantification, scale, and implications revealed by this model are likely to be quite surprising. The model provides a novel perspective and concrete numbers that challenge common assumptions about climate migration's impact.

The rating isn't higher because some elements (like the general concept of diversity driving innovation) are already recognized in these communities. However, the specific quantification and the magnitude of the effects modeled here are likely to be eye-opening for many, justifying a solidly above-average surprise rating.

### Topic Relevance (20%): 7.50/10

#### Run 1:

To evaluate the importance of this Fermi model to the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider its relevance and impact potential, scoring it on a scale from 0 to 10.

- The insights about concentration of migrants in innovation hubs and the importance of integration could inform policy recommendations and interventions.
- However, the model's focus on innovation in developed countries may limit its direct applicability to some effective altruism priorities focused on the global poor.

Overall Score: 7.5/10

This score reflects that the model is significantly above the median in importance to these communities. Its novel approach, rigorous methodology, and potential to influence thinking on a major global issue make it highly relevant. The concrete, quantifiable insights it provides could meaningfully impact decision-making and priority-setting, particularly in areas related to climate change adaptation and migration policy. However, it falls short of the highest possible score due to its somewhat narrow focus on innovation outcomes, which, while important, may not encompass the full range of concerns these communities have regarding climate migration.

### Robustness (20%): 7.17/10

#### Run 1:

To evaluate the robustness of this Fermi model, I'll consider the factors you've outlined and provide a detailed justification for my rating.

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model acknowledges and attempts to account for uncertainty in key parameters using probability distributions. This is a strength, as it allows for a range of possible outcomes rather than relying on point estimates. However, some assumptions, such as the percentage of migrants moving to innovation hubs and the skilled worker percentage, could significantly impact the results if they deviate from the modeled distributions.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model cites several credible sources for its key assumptions, including World Bank projections for climate migration and USPTO data for innovation rates. The use of historical data to inform parameters is a positive aspect. However, the model could be strengthened by providing more explicit citations for some of its assumptions, particularly around the network effect multipliers.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates good methodological rigor in several ways:

- It uses probability distributions to model uncertainty
- It accounts for both positive factors (network effects) and negative factors (resource constraints)
- It provides sensitivity analysis by outputting confidence intervals

The step-by-step approach and clear explanations of each parameter enhance the model's transparency.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Many of the model's assumptions align with generally accepted views in the rationalist and EA communities, such as the potential for diversity to drive innovation and the challenges of infrastructure strain in receiving areas. The conservative approach to estimating patent value is also in line with typical EA thinking.

Strengths:

- Comprehensive consideration of various factors affecting innovation from migration
- Use of probability distributions to model uncertainty
- Clear structure and explanations
- Consideration of both positive and negative factors

Weaknesses:

- Some key assumptions (e.g., 15% of migrants moving to innovation hubs) could benefit from stronger justification
- The model doesn't account for potential diminishing returns in innovation as the number of migrants increases
- The assumption of a linear relationship between time and patent production over 30 years may be oversimplified

Overall Rating: 7/10

Justification:
This model demonstrates above-average robustness for a Fermi estimate. Its use of probability distributions, consideration of multiple factors, and transparent methodology are significant strengths. The model also acknowledges its limitations and major sources of uncertainty, which is important for a robust analysis.

However, there are areas where the model could be improved to increase its robustness further. More explicit justification for some key assumptions and consideration of potential non-linear effects would strengthen the analysis. Additionally, while the model does a good job of capturing uncertainty, some of the ranges (particularly for climate migration projections) are quite wide, which impacts the precision of the final estimates.

Despite these limitations, the model provides valuable insights and a thoughtful approach to quantifying a complex and often overlooked aspect of climate migration. Its conservative approach and clear acknowledgment of uncertainties add to its credibility.

A score of 7/10 reflects that this model is more robust than the median expectation (5/10) for a Fermi estimate, but still has room for improvement to be considered highly robust (10/10).

---

#### Run 2:

After carefully reviewing the provided Fermi model, I'll evaluate its robustness based on the specified criteria and provide a numeric score. Let's break down the evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model incorporates uncertainty through probabilistic distributions for most key parameters, which is a strength. However, some critical assumptions, such as the 15% of climate migrants moving to innovation hubs, could significantly alter the results if changed. The model's reliance on network effects and multipliers also makes it sensitive to these assumptions.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model draws from credible sources like World Bank projections and USPTO data. It also references studies on diverse teams and knowledge transfer effects. However, some specific data points (e.g., the 48% increase in patents from diverse teams) would benefit from more robust citation.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates strong methodological rigor by using appropriate probability distributions to represent uncertainty, accounting for both positive factors (network effects) and negative constraints (infrastructure and integration challenges). The step-by-step approach is logical and well-structured.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Many of the model's core assumptions align with generally accepted views in rationalist and EA communities, particularly regarding the potential benefits of migration and diversity. However, some of the more optimistic assumptions about network effects and knowledge transfer might be seen as speculative by some.

Detailed Justification:

Strengths:

1. Comprehensive uncertainty modeling using appropriate probability distributions.
2. Consideration of both positive and negative factors affecting innovation output.
3. Clear structure and logical flow of calculations.
4. Attempts to quantify often-overlooked positive externalities of climate migration.
5. Conservative approach in some areas to avoid overestimation.

Weaknesses:

1. High sensitivity to key assumptions, particularly around migration patterns to innovation hubs.
2. Some data points could benefit from stronger citation or meta-analysis.
3. Potential overreliance on network effects and multipliers, which are difficult to predict accurately.
4. Limited consideration of potential negative impacts on innovation in migrants' origin countries.

Rating: 7/10

This model is more robust than the median expectation (5/10) due to its comprehensive uncertainty modeling, logical structure, and consideration of both positive and negative factors. It loses points primarily due to its sensitivity to key assumptions and the speculative nature of some of its multipliers.

The model's strengths in methodological rigor and its attempt to quantify a complex and often-overlooked phenomenon are commendable. However, the high degree of uncertainty in climate migration projections and the difficulty in accurately predicting long-term innovation impacts prevent it from scoring higher.

This model provides valuable insights and a strong foundation for further research, but its conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the inherent uncertainties in long-term forecasting of complex social phenomena.

---

#### Run 3:

I'll evaluate this Fermi model based on the criteria you've outlined, considering sensitivity to assumptions, evidence base, methodological rigor, and consensus of assumptions.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions: 7/10
   The model acknowledges and quantifies uncertainty in key parameters, using probability distributions rather than point estimates. This approach allows for sensitivity analysis and provides confidence intervals for the results. The use of beta and normal distributions for various factors is appropriate and helps capture the inherent uncertainty.

However, some assumptions, like the 15% of migrants moving to innovation hubs, could significantly impact the results if changed. The model would benefit from a more detailed sensitivity analysis on this particular assumption.

2. Evidence Base: 8/10
   The model draws from credible sources, including World Bank projections for climate migration and USPTO data for innovation rates. The use of academic research to inform factors like the diversity multiplier (48% increase in patents) and knowledge transfer multiplier (25% boost) strengthens the evidence base.

The model could be improved by providing more explicit citations for some of the data points and assumptions used.

3. Methodological Rigor: 8/10
   The model demonstrates strong methodological rigor. It breaks down the problem into logical components, considers various factors that could influence the outcome, and uses appropriate statistical techniques to model uncertainty. The use of Monte Carlo simulation (implicit in the Squiggle language) is a robust approach for this type of estimation.

The model also acknowledges potential negative factors (infrastructure strain, integration delays) which adds to its credibility. However, it could be strengthened by considering potential correlations between some of the input variables.

4. Consensus of Assumptions: 7/10
   Many of the assumptions used in the model align with commonly accepted views in the rationalist and EA communities. The focus on second-order effects and potential positive outcomes from challenging situations is characteristic of these communities' approach.

However, some assumptions, particularly about the concentration of migrants in innovation hubs and the magnitude of the network effects, might be seen as optimistic by some. The model could benefit from a more detailed justification of these assumptions.

Overall Score: 7.5/10

Justification:
This model demonstrates several strengths that contribute to its robustness:

1. Comprehensive consideration of factors: It includes both positive (diversity, knowledge transfer) and negative (infrastructure strain, integration delays) influences on innovation.

2. Appropriate use of probability distributions: This allows for a nuanced understanding of the uncertainty in the estimates.

3. Logical structure: The model breaks down the problem into clear, understandable components.

4. Conservative approach: The model aims to avoid overestimation while still revealing significant potential benefits.

5. Clear communication of insights and uncertainties: The model provides key insights and explicitly states major sources of uncertainty.

Areas for improvement include:

1. More detailed sensitivity analysis, particularly for key assumptions like the percentage of migrants moving to innovation hubs.

2. More explicit citations for data sources and assumptions.

3. Consideration of potential correlations between input variables.

4. Further justification for some of the more optimistic assumptions.

Given these factors, I would rate this model a 7.5 out of 10 for robustness. It's above average in its approach and execution, with clear strengths in methodology and uncertainty quantification, but there's still room for refinement in some areas.

## 2. kairos* (submission-kairos*-1740681077355)

**Final Score**: 7.60/10

### Surprise (40%): 7.00/10

#### Run 1:

Surprise Rating: 7/10

This Fermi model and its conclusions are quite surprising for several reasons:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The model challenges the common intuition that throwing massive amounts of money at a problem will lead to proportionally massive results. Many in the EA community might expect that $4 trillion in donations would save far more than 12 million lives annually.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The model reveals the hidden complexity of diminishing returns in charitable giving. It shows that even with enormous resources, there's a ceiling to how many lives can be saved due to practical limitations.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model uncovers the concept of "absorption capacity" in effective altruism, which is not frequently discussed. It highlights that the ability to scale up interventions is a critical limiting factor, even when funding is abundant.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The difference between the intuitive expectation (potentially hundreds of millions of lives saved with $4 trillion) and the model's result (12 million lives) is significant.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The use of a saturation model (1 - exp(-D/D_scale)) is an innovative approach to modeling diminishing returns in charity effectiveness.

2. The estimate of L_max (10-15 million lives per year) is surprisingly low given the global scale of poverty and health issues, which many EAs might find counter to their expectations.

3. The D_scale of $100 billion suggests that the most effective interventions saturate much more quickly than many might expect.

4. The conclusion that we would essentially reach the maximum possible impact (L ≈ L_max) with this level of donation is particularly surprising and thought-provoking.

While the model's approach and conclusions are quite surprising, I've rated it a 7/10 rather than higher because some elements (like diminishing returns in charity) are known concepts in EA, even if their magnitude might be unexpected. Additionally, the model's core idea – that there are practical limits to scaling up interventions – is not entirely new, though the quantification and specific conclusions drawn from it are quite surprising.

---

#### Run 2:

Surprise Rating: 7/10

This Fermi model presents several surprising aspects that would likely challenge the expectations of many in the rationalist and effective altruism communities:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The model suggests that even with an enormous $4 trillion donation pool, only about 12 million lives could be saved annually. This significantly contradicts the intuitive assumption that such a vast sum would save hundreds of millions or even billions of lives.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The model introduces a counterintuitive concept of diminishing returns and saturation in charitable interventions. It reveals that there's a practical limit to how many lives can be saved, even with unlimited funding.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model uncovers the previously unrecognized issue of intervention capacity. It highlights that the bottleneck in saving lives isn't just about money, but also about the limited scale at which highly effective interventions can operate.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The deviation from common expectations is significant. Many in the EA community might expect that if everyone in the West donated 10% of their income, it would solve most of the world's problems. The model suggests a much more modest (though still substantial) impact.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The concept of Lmax (maximum lives that can be effectively saved) being only 10-15 million per year, despite the enormous funding available.

2. The introduction of Dscale (funding scale over which cost-effectiveness declines) set at only $100 billion, which is a tiny fraction of the total donation pool.

3. The implication that beyond a certain point (around $100 billion in this model), additional funding has negligible impact on lives saved.

4. The suggestion that current highly effective interventions have a relatively small total funding capacity compared to the potential donation pool.

These findings would likely spark significant discussion and potentially lead to a re-evaluation of strategies within the EA community. The model challenges the notion that simply increasing donations is sufficient and highlights the need for developing new, scalable interventions.

Given these factors, I rate this model as a 7/10 on the surprise scale. While not completely overturning existing beliefs, it presents a significantly different perspective on the potential impact of large-scale donations and the practical limits of current interventions.

#### Run 3:

Surprise Rating: 7/10

This Fermi model presents several findings that would likely be surprising to many members of the rationalist and effective altruism communities. Here's why:

1. Contradiction of Expectations:
   The model challenges the widely held belief that donating more money to effective charities would lead to a linear or near-linear increase in lives saved. Many in the EA community might expect that $4 trillion in donations would save hundreds of millions or even billions of lives, given the often-cited figures of $3,000-$5,000 per life saved.

2. Counterintuitiveness:
   The model reveals the hidden complexity of diminishing returns and saturation effects in charitable interventions. This non-obvious relationship between funding and impact is captured through the use of an exponential model, which is more sophisticated than the simple multiplication often used in back-of-the-envelope calculations.

3. Discovery of Unknowns:
   The model uncovers the concept of a maximum number of lives that can be effectively saved given current intervention opportunities (Lmax). This introduces a practical limit to the scalability of effective interventions, which might not be immediately apparent to many in the EA community.

4. Magnitude of Difference:
   The final estimate of 12 million lives saved per year is significantly lower than what many might intuitively expect from a $4 trillion donation pool. This large deviation from common expectations contributes to the surprising nature of the findings.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The model suggests that even with $4 trillion in donations, we would quickly reach the maximum potential impact of current interventions.
2. The introduction of a "funding scale" (Dscale) over which cost-effectiveness declines is a nuanced approach that many might not have considered.
3. The estimate of only 10-15 million lives that can be effectively saved per year given current intervention opportunities is likely lower than many would expect.

These findings challenge the simplistic view of "more money = more lives saved" and highlight the complexities and limitations in scaling up effective interventions. This more nuanced understanding of the relationship between funding and impact is likely to be eye-opening for many in the EA community, hence the relatively high surprise rating of 7/10.

### Topic Relevance (20%): 9.00/10

Thank you for providing this detailed Fermi model for evaluation. I'll assess its robustness based on the criteria you've outlined, providing a numeric score and justification.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions: 7/10
   The model acknowledges the sensitivity of its results to key assumptions, particularly in steps 2 and 3. It uses a range for cost-effectiveness ($3,000 to $20,000 per life saved) and introduces a saturation model to account for diminishing returns. This approach demonstrates awareness of the limitations of linear extrapolation and adds robustness to the estimate.

2. Evidence Base: 6/10
   The model uses credible macroeconomic data (GDP of "the West") and references global health data. However, it could be strengthened by citing specific sources for these figures and for the cost-effectiveness estimates. The lack of explicit citations slightly reduces its robustness.

3. Methodological Rigor: 8/10
   The methodology is sound and well-reasoned. The use of a saturation model (step 3) is particularly commendable, as it addresses a common flaw in simplistic linear projections. The mathematical approach is appropriate and well-explained.

4. Consensus of Assumptions: 7/10
   Many of the model's assumptions align well with common understanding in EA circles, particularly the acknowledgment of diminishing returns and the range of cost-effectiveness for interventions. The estimate of 10-15 million maximum lives saved annually seems plausible but could benefit from more explicit justification.

Overall Score: 7/10

Justification:
This Fermi model demonstrates several strengths that contribute to its robustness:

1. It acknowledges and attempts to model the complexities of large-scale charitable giving, particularly diminishing returns and saturation effects.
2. The mathematical approach used to model saturation is sophisticated yet clearly explained.
3. It avoids the common pitfall of linear extrapolation from small-scale effectiveness to large-scale impact.
4. The model is transparent about its assumptions and limitations.

Areas that could be improved to increase robustness:

1. More explicit citations for data sources would strengthen the evidence base.
2. Further justification for the choice of Lmax and Dscale parameters would add credibility.
3. Consideration of potential negative effects of such large-scale redirection of funds could provide a more comprehensive picture.

In conclusion, this model is more robust than the median expectation (5/10) due to its thoughtful approach to complex dynamics and clear methodology. While there is room for improvement in terms of sourcing and parameter justification, the overall approach is sound and aligns well with current understanding in the EA community. The final estimate of 12 million lives saved annually is presented appropriately as an approximation, reflecting the inherent uncertainties in such a complex estimation.

---

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions: 7/10
   The model acknowledges the sensitivity of its assumptions by providing ranges for key parameters (e.g., $3,000 to $20,000 per life saved, Lmax of 10-15 million). The use of a saturation model (exponential approach to a maximum) is a strength, as it captures diminishing returns more realistically than a linear model would. However, the choice of Dscale at $100 billion is a critical assumption that significantly impacts the results.

2. Evidence Base: 6/10
   The model cites global health data and references to cost-effectiveness estimates from the EA community, which provides a reasonable foundation. However, more specific citations or links to these data sources would strengthen the evidence base. The $40 trillion GDP figure for "the West" could benefit from a clearer definition and source.

3. Methodological Rigor: 8/10
   The methodology is sound and well-explained. The use of a mathematical model to capture diminishing returns is particularly strong. The step-by-step breakdown of the calculation enhances transparency. The acknowledgment of uncertainties and the use of ranges for key parameters demonstrate good rigor.

4. Consensus of Assumptions: 7/10
   Many of the underlying assumptions, such as the existence of highly effective interventions and diminishing returns in charity, align well with common views in the EA community. The specific numbers chosen (e.g., Lmax, Dscale) might be more debatable, but they seem to be within reasonable ranges based on EA discourse.

Overall Score: 7/10

Justification:
This model demonstrates several robust features:

1. It acknowledges and attempts to quantify diminishing returns, a crucial factor often overlooked in simpler models.
2. It uses a mathematically sound approach to model saturation effects.
3. It provides ranges for key parameters, showing an understanding of uncertainty.

The model also acknowledges limitations and uncertainties, which is a sign of rigor. The step-by-step breakdown of the calculation enhances transparency.

4. Consensus of Assumptions: 7/10
   Many of the model's core assumptions align well with common views in the EA community, such as the focus on highly effective interventions and the recognition of diminishing returns. The concept of donating 10% of income is well-established (e.g., Giving What We Can pledge). However, the specific parameters chosen (like Dscale) might be more debatable.

Overall Robustness Score: 7/10

Justification:
This model demonstrates several strengths that contribute to its robustness:

1. It uses a mathematically sound approach to capture diminishing returns, which is crucial for this type of estimate.
2. It acknowledges and attempts to quantify key uncertainties, such as the range of lives that could potentially be saved.
3. The model is transparent about its assumptions and methodology, allowing for easy critique and refinement.
4. It aligns well with established thinking in the EA community regarding donation impact and global health interventions.

However, there are also some limitations:

1. The model could benefit from more specific citations for its key figures, especially the GDP estimate and the range of cost-effectiveness for interventions.
2. The choice of Dscale at $100 billion, while plausible, could use more justification or sensitivity analysis.
3. The model doesn't account for potential negative effects of such large-scale redistribution of wealth, which could be significant.

In conclusion, this Fermi estimate provides a thoughtful and mathematically sound approach to a complex question. Its primary strengths lie in its methodological rigor and alignment with EA principles. While there's room for improvement in evidential support and sensitivity analysis, the model's overall approach and transparency make it more robust than the median expectation, justifying a score of 7/10.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The idea that answering a simple query in Chinese could be equivalent to building an entire city is highly non-obvious. It reveals the hidden complexity of language models in a tangible way.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: This model uncovers the vast gap between human and machine computational capabilities, which might not have been fully appreciated before. It highlights the efficiency of AI systems in a new light.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The scale of the comparison is significant. We're not talking about a small task, but about building a city for millions of people, which emphasizes the enormous computational power of LLMs.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The calculation that a single token generation requires about 35,000 man-years of human computation is particularly striking.

2. The fact that a simple question-answer pair in Chinese (15-40 tokens) equates to 500,000-1,500,000 man-years of work is almost difficult to comprehend.

3. The comparison to Brasília's construction provides a concrete, historical reference point that makes the abstract numbers more relatable and surprising.

While the rationalist and EA communities are generally aware of the power of AI systems, this specific comparison to city-building provides a new and surprising perspective on the scale of AI computations. It's likely to challenge even informed individuals' intuitions about the computational demands of language models.

### Robustness (20%): 6.67/10

#### Run 1:

Evaluation of the Fermi Model:

Score: 6/10

Justification:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model relies on several key assumptions that could significantly impact the results if altered. These include:

- The human capacity to perform MAC operations (1 every 5 seconds)
- The number of MAC operations per token for LLama 3 8B
- The number of tokens in a simple Chinese question and answer pair
- The labor requirements and timelines for city construction

While these assumptions seem reasonable, small changes could lead to large differences in the final comparison. This sensitivity somewhat reduces the model's robustness.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model uses some credible data points, such as:

- The parameters of the LLama 3 8B model
- Estimates of full-time work hours per year
- The example of Brasília's construction

However, more recent and specific data on LLM computational requirements and modern city-building efforts would strengthen the evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates good methodological rigor by:

- Breaking down complex processes into smaller, estimable components
- Providing ranges rather than single point estimates
- Cross-checking estimates with a real-world example (Brasília)

The approach is logical and transparent, which adds to its robustness.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Many of the assumptions used in this model would likely be accepted within the rationalist and EA communities, such as:

- The computational intensity of LLMs
- The general scale of effort required for city-building
- The approach of breaking down complex tasks into more manageable estimates

However, some specific numbers (like MAC operations per second for humans) might be debated.

Strengths:

- Clear and logical breakdown of both LLM operations and city-building processes
- Use of ranges to account for uncertainty
- Validation against a real-world example (Brasília)
- Consideration of various aspects of city-building (infrastructure, residential/commercial construction)

Weaknesses:

- High sensitivity to initial assumptions, particularly in the LLM calculation
- Lack of recent, specific data on LLM computational requirements
- Potential oversimplification of the complexity of LLM operations
- Limited consideration of technological advancements in city-building since the 1950s

Overall, the model provides a thought-provoking comparison and uses sound reasoning. Its main strengths lie in its methodological approach and the attempt to validate with real-world data. However, its reliance on several key assumptions that could significantly alter the results if changed limits its robustness. The score of 6/10 reflects a model that is above average in robustness but still has room for improvement in terms of data sources and sensitivity analysis.

---

#### Run 2:

Evaluation of the Fermi Model:

Score: 7/10

Justification:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model relies on several key assumptions, but most are reasonably justified or conservative. The estimate of human computation speed (1 MAC per 5 seconds) is a critical assumption, but it's likely on the conservative side, which strengthens the model's robustness. The estimation of MAC operations for LLM token generation is well-reasoned, considering parameter count and additional computations. The model's conclusion is not overly sensitive to small changes in these assumptions, which adds to its robustness.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model draws from credible sources and up-to-date information on LLM architectures (specifically Llama 3 8B). The city-building comparison uses real-world data from the construction of Brasília, which provides a solid empirical foundation. However, more diverse examples of city construction could further strengthen the evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates strong methodological rigor. It breaks down complex processes into manageable components, uses conservative estimates where uncertainty exists, and provides clear step-by-step calculations. The comparison between LLM computation and city-building is creative and well-structured. The model also acknowledges ranges of uncertainty (e.g., 15-40 tokens for a question-answer pair), which adds to its credibility.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Most of the assumptions used in this model align well with commonly accepted views in the rationalist and EA communities. The focus on computational complexity, the use of man-years as a measure of effort, and the comparison to large-scale human endeavors are all approaches that would likely find acceptance in these communities.

Strengths:

- Well-structured and clearly explained calculations
- Use of real-world data (Brasília construction) to validate estimates
- Conservative estimates that strengthen the robustness of conclusions
- Creative and thought-provoking comparison between AI computation and human construction efforts

Weaknesses:

- Reliance on a single example (Brasília) for city-building comparison
- Potential oversimplification of LLM architecture complexities
- Limited exploration of potential variations in human computation speed

Overall, this model demonstrates a high degree of robustness. Its conservative assumptions, clear methodology, and use of real-world data to validate estimates all contribute to its strength. While there are areas where additional data or more nuanced analysis could further improve the model, its current form provides a compelling and well-reasoned comparison that is likely to be resilient to moderate scrutiny or variations in its assumptions.

---

#### Run 3:

Evaluation of the Fermi Model:

Score: 7/10

Justification:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model relies on several key assumptions, but most are reasonably conservative or based on credible estimates. The assumption of 1 MAC operation every 5 seconds for a human is a significant simplification but serves as a reasonable baseline. The estimate of MAC operations for LLama 3 8B is well-justified and includes consideration for additional computational overhead. The model's sensitivity to these assumptions is moderate, as changes would scale the result proportionally without fundamentally altering the conclusion.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model draws from credible technical specifications (e.g., LLama 3 8B parameters) and real-world examples (construction of Brasília). The use of ranges for several estimates (e.g., tokens in a Chinese question-answer pair, years for infrastructure construction) acknowledges uncertainty and improves robustness. However, more recent or diverse examples of city construction could strengthen the evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates strong methodological rigor. It breaks down complex processes into manageable components, uses conservative estimates, and provides clear calculations. The comparison between LLM computation and city construction is creative and well-structured. The model acknowledges uncertainties and provides ranges where appropriate. However, it could benefit from more explicit discussion of potential biases or limitations.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Most assumptions used in this model align well with commonly accepted figures in the AI and urban development fields. The estimate of human computation speed, while simplified, is reasonable. The breakdown of city construction phases and labor requirements is generally consistent with urban planning literature.

Strengths:

- Well-structured comparison between two complex systems
- Use of ranges to account for uncertainties
- Grounding in real-world examples and technical specifications
- Conservative estimates that likely don't overstate the conclusion

Weaknesses:

- Reliance on a single historical example for city construction validation
- Simplified model of human computation capabilities
- Limited discussion of potential biases or limitations

Overall, this model demonstrates strong robustness in its approach and conclusions. While there are areas where it could be refined or expanded, the core methodology and reasoning are sound, and the conclusion is likely to hold under reasonable variations in the assumptions. The creative comparison between LLM computation and city construction provides a compelling perspective on the scale of AI computations.

**Final Score**: 7.10/10

### Surprise (40%): 7.00/10

#### Run 1:

Surprise Rating: 7/10

This model presents findings that are quite surprising for the rationalist and effective altruism communities, for several reasons:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The model suggests that it's potentially feasible to influence future AI systems through targeted data injection, which contradicts the common assumption that large language models are too robust to be significantly swayed by small amounts of data.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The idea that one could potentially influence an AI system's decision-making for as little as $1,000 is counterintuitive, given the enormous scale of data these models are typically trained on.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model uncovers a potential vulnerability in AI systems that isn't widely discussed - the possibility of strategic, targeted data injection to bias model outputs.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The range of costs ($1,000 to $100,000) to potentially influence an AI system is surprisingly low compared to the typical costs associated with AI development and training.

Specific aspects that contribute to the surprising nature of the findings:

1. The lower bound estimate of $1,000 to have a non-trivial chance of influencing an AI judge is particularly surprising. This suggests a much lower barrier to entry for potential manipulation than most would expect.

2. The model highlights that even with robust filtering and source weighting, there's still a potential vulnerability that could be exploited with strategic placement of content.

3. The implication that well-funded actors could potentially bias AI decision-making at scale is a concerning insight that isn't widely recognized.

4. The model frames AI vulnerability in terms of financial feasibility, which is an unusual and thought-provoking perspective.

While some aspects of the model align with existing concerns about AI safety and data integrity, the specific quantification and the surprisingly low cost estimates make these findings more concrete and alarming than typical discussions in these communities.

The 7/10 rating reflects that while these findings are quite surprising and potentially consequential, they don't completely upend existing paradigms. They build on known concerns about AI safety and data manipulation but present them in a more quantified and actionable way that may shift how the community thinks about these issues.

---

#### Run 2:

Surprising Score: 7/10

This model and its conclusions are quite surprising for several reasons:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The model suggests that influencing a large language model's decision-making through targeted data injection could be feasible with a relatively modest budget (as low as $1,000). This contradicts the common assumption that AI systems, especially those developed by major tech companies, would be highly resistant to such manipulation.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The idea that one could potentially bias an AI judge in a contest for as little as $1,000 is counterintuitive. Many would expect that influencing such a complex system would require far more resources or sophisticated techniques.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model uncovers a potential vulnerability in AI systems that may not have been widely recognized or discussed in the rationalist and EA communities. It highlights the importance of data integrity and the potential for coordinated efforts to systematically bias AI decision-making over time.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The range of costs ($1,000 to $100,000) to potentially influence an AI system is significantly lower than what many might expect, especially considering the billions of dollars invested in developing these systems.

Specific aspects that contribute to the surprising nature of the findings:

1. The lower bound estimate of $1,000 for a non-trivial chance of influencing the AI is particularly striking. This suggests that even individuals or small groups could potentially attempt such manipulation.

2. The model's implication that well-funded actors could have a significant impact on AI decision-making through strategic content placement is concerning and might not have been fully appreciated before.

3. The insight that injecting content into just 0.01%-1% of the training data could potentially have a measurable impact is surprising and raises questions about the robustness of current AI training methods.

4. The model highlights a potential asymmetry in AI security, where the cost to potentially compromise a system is orders of magnitude less than the cost to develop it.

While some in the rationalist and EA communities may have considered the possibility of influencing AI through training data, the specific quantification and relatively low cost estimates make this model more surprising than the median expectation, hence the score of 7/10.

---

#### Run 3:

Surprise Rating: 7/10

This model and its conclusions are quite surprising for several reasons:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The model suggests that influencing a future AI system's decision-making could be achieved with a relatively modest investment (as low as $1,000). This contradicts the common assumption that AI systems, especially large language models, are too complex and data-rich to be meaningfully influenced by small-scale interventions.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The idea that one could potentially bias an AI judge in a contest through strategic content injection is not immediately obvious. It reveals a potential vulnerability in AI systems that many in the rationalist and EA communities might not have considered.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model uncovers a previously unrecognized risk in AI development - the potential for well-funded actors to systematically bias AI decision-making over time through strategic content injection.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The range of costs ($1,000 to $100,000) to potentially influence an AI system is surprisingly low compared to the typical costs associated with AI development and training, which often run into millions or billions of dollars.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The lower bound estimate of $1,000 to have a non-trivial chance of influencing the AI is particularly surprising. This suggests that even individuals or small organizations could potentially impact AI systems, which is a significant deviation from the common perception that only large tech companies or governments can meaningfully influence AI development.

2. The model's suggestion that 0.01%-1% of training data could be enough to meaningfully bias the model's decision-making is lower than what many might expect, given the vast amounts of data used in training large language models.

3. The practical implications, such as the potential for Elon Musk to replace USAID grantmakers with language models, highlight unexpected ways in which biased AI systems could impact real-world decision-making and resource allocation.

4. The model reveals a potential "attack vector" for manipulating AI systems that isn't widely discussed in the community, focusing on training data manipulation rather than more commonly considered risks like prompt engineering or model theft.

While not reaching the highest levels of surprise (which would involve completely overturning established beliefs), this model presents findings that are likely to be quite surprising and thought-provoking for many in the rationalist and EA communities, warranting a score of 7/10.

### Topic Relevance (20%): 8.17/10

- The cost estimates provided could inform discussions about the feasibility of certain AI safety interventions or risks.
- However, the impact is somewhat limited by the speculative nature of the model and the rapidly evolving field of AI development.

Overall Score: 7.5/10

This score reflects that the model addresses a topic of significant interest to the rationalist and EA communities, with potential to influence discussions and decision-making in AI safety and governance. It's above the median expectation (5) due to its direct relevance to core EA and rationalist concerns about AI development and its potential to spark important conversations about AI vulnerabilities and safeguards.

The score isn't higher because while highly relevant, it's not addressing the absolute most critical issues in these communities (like concrete AI alignment proposals or existential risk reduction strategies), and its impact potential, while significant, is somewhat limited by its speculative nature and the rapidly changing landscape of AI development.

1. Relatively small actors could potentially influence large AI systems, which might prompt increased focus on data integrity and training set curation.
2. There may be a need for new ethical guidelines or regulations around AI training data.
3. The EA community might need to consider the cost-effectiveness of "AI influence campaigns" as potential interventions.

The model also highlights potential vulnerabilities in AI systems that could be exploited by bad actors, which might influence research priorities in AI safety.

Overall Score: 8.5/10

This score reflects the high relevance and significant impact potential of the model. It addresses core concerns of the rationalist and EA communities (AI alignment, information hazards, cost-effectiveness of interventions) while providing concrete estimates that could inform strategy and policy.

The score is not a 10 because:

1. The model focuses on a specific scenario (contest judging) rather than more general AI influence.
2. There's uncertainty about the real-world applicability and scalability of the proposed method.
3. The ethical implications of such manipulation might limit its direct use by these communities.

However, the insights provided are valuable enough to place this model well above the median in terms of importance to these communities.

### Robustness (20%): 6.33/10

#### Run 1:

Evaluation Score: 6/10

Justification:

This Fermi model presents an interesting analysis of the potential costs and feasibility of manipulating a language model's training data to bias its decision-making. While the model has several strengths, there are also some limitations that affect its overall robustness. Let's examine the factors:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions (5/10):
   The model is moderately sensitive to its core assumptions. The assumption that 0.01%-1% of training data needs to contain the activation phrase is a critical driver of the results. While this range is plausible, it's not strongly justified and could significantly impact the outcome if incorrect. The assumption of $1 per million tokens for text generation is reasonable but could fluctuate based on market conditions or technological advancements.

2. Evidence Base (6/10):
   The model draws on relevant comparisons to adversarial attacks in NLP, SEO manipulation, and AI-generated spam campaigns. It also references scaling laws from past LLM training datasets, which adds credibility. However, the evidence is mostly indirect, and there's a lack of direct empirical data on successful manipulation of large language models through training data injection.

3. Methodological Rigor (7/10):
   The approach is logical and follows sound Fermi estimation principles. The model breaks down the problem into key components (required tokens, cost per token, percentage of training data needed) and provides both lower and upper bounds. The consideration of practical barriers like filtering, source weighting, and data curation cycles demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the problem.

4. Consensus of Assumptions (6/10):
   Many of the underlying assumptions, such as the scale of training data for large language models and the challenges of data poisoning, align with current understanding in the AI and effective altruism communities. However, the specific percentages and costs might be debated, as there's still significant uncertainty in this area.

Strengths:

- Comprehensive consideration of various factors affecting the feasibility of the proposed manipulation.
- Clear explanation of the estimation process and underlying assumptions.
- Acknowledgment of practical barriers and limitations beyond just the financial cost.

Weaknesses:

- Lack of direct empirical evidence to support key assumptions.
- Potential oversimplification of the complexities involved in influencing a language model's decision-making process.
- Limited exploration of potential countermeasures or detection methods for such manipulation attempts.

Overall, this model provides a thought-provoking analysis of a complex issue. Its strengths lie in its logical approach and consideration of multiple factors. However, the reliance on several unverified assumptions and the lack of direct empirical evidence limit its robustness. The score of 6/10 reflects a model that is above average in its approach and insights but falls short of being highly robust due to these limitations.

---

#### Run 2:

I'll evaluate this Fermi model based on the criteria you've outlined, considering sensitivity to assumptions, evidence base, methodological rigor, and consensus of assumptions.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model relies on several key assumptions, including the size of the training dataset (10 trillion tokens), the required percentage of adversarial content (0.01%-1%), and the cost of text generation ($1 per million tokens). These assumptions are reasonably justified but could significantly impact the results if changed. The model acknowledges this by providing a range of estimates, which is a strength.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model draws on relevant comparisons to adversarial attacks in NLP, scaling laws from past LLM training datasets, and current API pricing for text generation. While these sources are appropriate, the model doesn't provide specific citations or links to these data points, which somewhat weakens the evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The approach uses sound Fermi estimation techniques, breaking down the problem into manageable components and providing both lower and upper bounds. The model also considers practical barriers beyond just the cost, such as filtering, data curation cycles, and scaling limitations. This demonstrates good methodological rigor.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   The underlying assumptions about LLM training data size, the impact of data poisoning, and the challenges of manipulating AI systems are generally in line with current understanding in the AI and effective altruism communities. The model's conclusion about the potential for well-funded actors to bias AI decision-making aligns with common concerns in these circles.

Strengths:

- Provides a range of estimates to account for uncertainty
- Considers practical barriers beyond just cost
- Aligns with current understanding of LLM vulnerabilities
- Uses appropriate comparisons and scaling laws

Weaknesses:

- Lacks specific citations for data points
- Some key assumptions (e.g., 0.01%-1% required content) could benefit from more justification
- Doesn't fully explore the potential for more sophisticated targeting strategies that might reduce required content volume

Rating: 7/10

Justification:
This model demonstrates good methodological rigor and aligns well with current understanding in the field. It provides a reasonable range of estimates and considers important practical factors beyond just the raw numbers. The acknowledgment of limitations and broader implications strengthens its credibility.

However, the lack of specific citations for key data points and the potential sensitivity to core assumptions prevent it from scoring higher. While the model is more robust than average (hence the above-median score), there's room for improvement in terms of evidence presentation and exploration of more sophisticated strategies.

The model's conclusion about the feasibility of well-funded actors manipulating AI systems is particularly valuable and aligns with broader concerns in the AI ethics community. This insight contributes significantly to the model's robustness.

In summary, while there are areas for improvement, this model provides a solid foundation for understanding the potential costs and challenges of manipulating LLM training data, making it more robust than the median expectation for such estimates.

#### Run 3:

Rating: 6/10

Justification:

This Fermi model presents an interesting approach to estimating the cost of influencing a language model's decision-making through data manipulation. While the model has several strengths, there are also some areas of concern that affect its overall robustness. Let's break down the evaluation based on the given factors:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions (6/10):
   The model relies on several key assumptions, such as the size of the training dataset (10 trillion tokens) and the required percentage of injected content (0.01%-1%). While these assumptions seem reasonable based on current language model trends, they are still speculative and could significantly impact the results if incorrect. The model does provide a range to account for some uncertainty, which is positive.

2. Evidence Base (5/10):
   The model draws on relevant comparisons to adversarial attacks in NLP and scaling laws from past LLM training datasets, which provides some grounding in real-world data. However, the specific sources are not cited, and it's unclear how up-to-date or comprehensive this information is. The use of LLM API pricing for cost estimates is a reasonable approach, but actual costs could vary.

3. Methodological Rigor (7/10):
   The model employs sound reasoning in its approach, breaking down the problem into manageable components and using relevant heuristics. The consideration of factors like differential weighting and filtering in model training pipelines adds depth to the analysis. However, the model could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how these factors were quantitatively incorporated into the final estimate.

4. Consensus of Assumptions (6/10):
   Many of the underlying assumptions, such as the scale of language model training and the potential for data manipulation, align with current discussions in the rationalist and EA communities. However, the specific percentages and thresholds used might be debated, and there's limited explanation of why these particular values were chosen.

Strengths:

- Addresses a relevant and thought-provoking question about AI security and influence
- Provides a clear range of estimates with upper and lower bounds
- Considers practical barriers beyond just the financial cost
- Acknowledges limitations and broader implications of the estimate

Weaknesses:

- Lacks specific citations for key data points and comparisons
- Could benefit from more explanation of how qualitative factors were quantitatively incorporated
- Doesn't explore potential countermeasures or how they might affect the estimate
- Assumes a linear relationship between content volume and influence, which may not hold true

Overall, this model presents a thoughtful approach to a complex question, balancing quantitative estimates with qualitative considerations. While it has some limitations in terms of evidence specificity and sensitivity to assumptions, it provides a useful framework for thinking about the issue of AI influence through data manipulation. The acknowledgment of practical barriers and broader implications adds valuable context to the numerical estimate.

Given these factors, I rate this model a 6/10 for robustness. It's above average in its approach and considerations but falls short of being highly robust due to the speculative nature of some key assumptions and the lack of specific citations for its evidence base.

## 5. Denkenberger (submission-denkenberger-1740680034357)

**Final Score**: 6.60/10

### Surprise (40%): 5.33/10

#### Run 1:

Based on the provided Fermi model submission, I would rate the surprisingness of the key findings as a 4 out of 10. Here's my reasoning:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The finding that research and planning is more cost-effective than stockpiling PPE is not entirely surprising. Many in the rationalist and EA communities already emphasize the importance of preparedness and planning over purely material solutions.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The magnitude of the difference (34-47 times more cost-effective) is somewhat counterintuitive and might be considered mildly surprising. However, large differences in cost-effectiveness between interventions are not uncommon in EA analyses.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model doesn't seem to uncover any previously unrecognized issues or risks. It mainly compares two known approaches to pandemic preparedness.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The 34-47 times difference in cost-effectiveness is significant, but not unprecedented in EA cost-effectiveness comparisons.

Specific details that illustrate the mildly surprising aspects:

1. The model suggests that even when considering full costs (not just philanthropic spending), research and planning is still substantially more cost-effective than stockpiling. This challenges the intuition that material preparations (like PPE) would be more directly impactful.

2. The robustness of the result across different cost scenarios (full costs vs. philanthropic costs) adds some weight to the surprising nature of the finding.

3. The model's self-generated numbers aligning with external estimates (like Kevin Esvelt's quote) lends credibility to the results, which might make the large difference in cost-effectiveness more surprising.

However, several factors reduce the overall surprisingness:

1. The EA community often finds large differences in cost-effectiveness between interventions, so the magnitude itself is not highly surprising.

2. The importance of research and planning is already well-recognized in EA circles, especially for low-probability, high-impact scenarios like extreme pandemics.

3. The model doesn't challenge any core assumptions or beliefs held by the rationalist or EA communities.

In conclusion, while the specific numbers and magnitude of difference might raise some eyebrows, the overall direction and implications of the findings align relatively well with existing EA thinking on pandemic preparedness. Therefore, a rating of 4 out of 10 on the surprisingness scale seems appropriate.

---

#### Run 2:

Based on the provided Fermi model submission, I would rate the surprising nature of the findings as a 6 out of 10. Here's my reasoning:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The finding that research and planning is significantly more cost-effective than stockpiling PPE is somewhat surprising. Many people might intuitively expect that having physical resources on hand (like PPE) would be more effective than planning alone. This contradicts the common "preparedness" mindset.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The magnitude of the difference in cost-effectiveness is counterintuitive. The model suggests that planning is 34-47 times more cost-effective than stockpiling, which is a substantial difference that might not be immediately apparent to most people.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model doesn't necessarily uncover completely unknown issues, but it does highlight the potential undervaluation of research and planning in pandemic preparedness, which might not be widely recognized.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The large difference in cost-effectiveness (34-47 times) is significant and would likely be surprising to many in the rationalist and EA communities.

Specific details that illustrate the surprising aspects:

1. The model suggests that even when considering all spending (not just philanthropic), planning is still 34 times more cost-effective than stockpiling. This challenges the notion that government stockpiling is the most efficient way to prepare for pandemics.

2. The finding that philanthropic spending on planning could be 47 times more cost-effective than stockpiling suggests a potentially high-impact opportunity that may not be widely recognized in the EA community.

3. The model's self-generated numbers aligning with expert estimates (like Kevin Esvelt's $20 billion quote) lends credibility to the surprising results.

While these findings are certainly noteworthy, they don't completely upend our understanding of pandemic preparedness. The general idea that planning and research are important is not new, even if the magnitude of their importance is surprising. Additionally, the EA and rationalist communities are often open to counterintuitive findings based on careful analysis, which slightly reduces the surprise factor.

Therefore, a score of 6 out of 10 seems appropriate, indicating that the findings are more surprising than average, but not completely revolutionary or paradigm-shifting.

---

#### Run 3:

To evaluate the level of surprise for the rationalist and effective altruism (EA) communities regarding this Fermi model, I'll consider the key findings and rate them on the 0-10 scale:

1. Cost-effectiveness comparison:
   The model suggests that research and planning is 34-47 times more cost-effective than stockpiling PPE. This is quite surprising, as many in the EA community might have assumed stockpiling to be more directly impactful. The magnitude of difference is significant.

Rating: 7/10

2. Philanthropic vs. full costs:
   The finding that considering only philanthropic spending makes planning even more cost-effective (47x vs 34x) is somewhat counterintuitive. This suggests that leveraging existing government funding can amplify the impact of philanthropic efforts.

Rating: 6/10

3. Scale of impact:
   The model deals with preventing the collapse of civilization, which is a key concern in EA circles. However, the fact that relatively modest investments in planning could have such a large impact on this existential risk might be surprising.

Rating: 5/10

4. Uncertainty and ranges:
   The wide ranges in the results (e.g., 8.5-140 times more cost-effective) reflect significant uncertainty, which is expected in such models but might be surprising in its extent.

Rating: 3/10

5. Neglectedness:
   The assertion that this is a neglected area aligns with EA thinking about cause prioritization, but the degree of neglect compared to the potential impact might be surprising.

Rating: 4/10

Overall rating: 6/10

This rating reflects that while some aspects of the model align with EA and rationalist thinking, the magnitude of the difference in cost-effectiveness and the potential impact of planning versus stockpiling is likely to be quite surprising to many in these communities. The model challenges some common assumptions about pandemic preparedness and highlights a potentially overlooked approach to addressing extreme risks.

The high cost-effectiveness of planning compared to stockpiling, especially when considering philanthropic spending, is the most surprising element. This finding could potentially shift priorities in pandemic preparedness efforts within these communities.

### Robustness (20%): 6.33/10

#### Run 1:

Thank you for providing this detailed Fermi model submission on pandemic interventions. I'll evaluate the robustness of the model's key findings based on the criteria you've outlined.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model incorporates uncertainty in many key parameters, which is a strength. For example, it uses mixture distributions for pandemic probability, infection fatality rate, and R0 value. This approach captures both baseline estimates and more extreme scenarios.

However, some assumptions could significantly impact results if changed:

- The definition and number of "essential workers"
- The effectiveness of interventions in preventing deaths
- Implementation success rates

The model would be more robust if it included sensitivity analyses for these key parameters.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model draws on some credible data sources, such as BLS estimates for essential workers. However, many parameters are based on expert judgment rather than hard data, which is understandable given the speculative nature of extreme pandemics.

The model would benefit from more explicit citations of data sources, especially for parameters like intervention effectiveness and implementation success rates.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model uses sound probabilistic reasoning and incorporates uncertainty appropriately. The use of mixture distributions to capture tail risks is particularly commendable.

The comparison between interventions is logical, considering both costs and effectiveness. However, the model could be improved by:

- Considering potential correlations between parameters
- Incorporating a more detailed breakdown of how interventions prevent collapse
- Addressing potential diminishing returns or interaction effects between interventions

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Many of the model's assumptions seem reasonable within rationalist and EA frameworks, particularly:

- The low but non-negligible probability of an extreme pandemic
- The focus on preventing civilizational collapse
- The consideration of both direct intervention (stockpiling) and systemic improvement (planning)

However, some assumptions might be more contentious:

- The relative effectiveness of planning vs. stockpiling
- The ability to implement complex plans during a crisis

Overall Robustness Score: 7/10

Justification:
The model demonstrates several strengths that contribute to its robustness:

- Comprehensive consideration of uncertainties
- Use of probabilistic methods and distributions
- Logical comparison of interventions
- Alignment with many EA/rationalist assumptions

However, there are areas where the model could be more robust:

- More explicit sourcing of data and assumptions
- Sensitivity analyses for key parameters
- More detailed modeling of intervention mechanisms
- Consideration of parameter correlations and interaction effects

While these limitations somewhat reduce confidence in the precise numerical outputs, the overall conclusion that planning interventions are likely more cost-effective than stockpiling seems reasonably robust. The model provides a solid foundation for further refinement and analysis of pandemic preparedness strategies.

---

#### Run 2:

Thank you for providing this detailed Fermi model submission for evaluation. I'll assess the robustness of the model's key findings based on the factors you've outlined.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model incorporates uncertainty ranges for most key parameters, which is a strength. However, some critical assumptions could significantly impact the results:

- The definition and number of "essential workers" vary widely (40M to 60M).
- The pandemic probability estimate (0.5% to 5% over 10 years) is highly uncertain and influential.
- The effectiveness of interventions (70-95% for stockpiling, 70-90% for planning) seems optimistic and could be overestimated.

These assumptions have wide ranges, which helps capture uncertainty, but also means the results are quite sensitive to these inputs.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model references some credible sources (e.g., BLS for essential worker numbers), which is positive. However, many of the input ranges seem to be expert estimates rather than based on hard data. This is understandable given the speculative nature of extreme pandemic scenarios, but it does weaken the evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model uses a logical structure and incorporates uncertainty through probability distributions, which is commendable. It also includes sensitivity analyses and visualization of results. However, there are some potential issues:

- The model doesn't account for potential negative consequences of interventions.
- The assumption that money will be plentiful during a pandemic may not hold in all scenarios.
- The model doesn't consider the potential for interventions to partially succeed or fail in different ways.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Many of the assumptions seem reasonable within the rationalist and EA communities, particularly the focus on existential risk and the importance of pandemic preparedness. However, some specific assumptions (e.g., the high effectiveness of interventions) might be more controversial.

Rating: 6/10

Justification:
The model demonstrates several strengths:

- Incorporation of uncertainty through probability distributions
- Consideration of multiple factors affecting intervention success
- Logical structure and clear presentation of results
- Inclusion of sensitivity analyses and visualizations

However, there are also significant limitations:

- Heavy reliance on expert estimates rather than hard data
- High sensitivity to uncertain key parameters
- Potential overestimation of intervention effectiveness
- Lack of consideration for partial successes or failures

The model provides a useful framework for thinking about the problem and comparing interventions. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the high uncertainty in many key inputs.

The rating of 6/10 reflects that while the model is above average in its approach and transparency, there are still substantial uncertainties and methodological limitations that affect the robustness of its conclusions. It provides valuable insights but should be seen as a starting point for further research and refinement rather than a definitive analysis.

---

#### Run 3:

Thank you for providing this detailed Fermi model for evaluation. I'll assess its robustness based on the criteria you've outlined, considering sensitivity to assumptions, evidence base, methodological rigor, and consensus of assumptions.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model incorporates uncertainty in many key parameters, which is a strength. However, some critical assumptions could significantly impact the results:

- The definition and number of "essential workers" (40-60M range)
- Pandemic probability (0.5-5% over 10 years)
- Effectiveness of interventions (60-95% range for various factors)

These wide ranges suggest high sensitivity to assumptions, which somewhat reduces robustness.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model cites some credible sources (e.g., BLS for essential worker numbers) and uses ranges that encompass expert estimates (e.g., Kevin Esvelt's $20B PPE estimate). However, many parameters are based on reasonable guesses rather than hard data, which is understandable given the speculative nature of extreme pandemic scenarios.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates good methodological practices:

- Uses probabilistic ranges for most parameters
- Incorporates implementation success rates
- Considers multiple factors in effectiveness calculations
- Includes sensitivity analysis through different distribution weights

However, it doesn't explicitly model second-order effects or potential correlations between variables, which could affect accuracy.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   Many of the model's assumptions align with general thinking in rationalist and EA communities:

- Low but non-negligible probability of extreme pandemics
- Importance of protecting essential workers
- Consideration of both direct intervention (PPE) and systemic approaches (planning)

The model's overall structure and approach seem consistent with EA modeling practices.

Strengths:

- Comprehensive consideration of relevant factors
- Use of probabilistic ranges to capture uncertainty
- Comparison of two distinct intervention approaches
- Inclusion of implementation challenges

Weaknesses:

- High sensitivity to some key assumptions
- Limited hard evidence for many parameter estimates
- Potential oversimplification of complex pandemic dynamics

Overall Rating: 6/10

Justification:
The model demonstrates good practices in Fermi estimation and uncertainty analysis. It considers a wide range of factors and uses reasonable ranges for most parameters. The comparison between two different approaches (stockpiling vs. planning) adds value to the analysis.

However, the high sensitivity to certain assumptions and the speculative nature of many parameter estimates reduce its robustness. The model's reliance on simplified linear relationships may not capture the full complexity of pandemic dynamics and societal responses.

The rating of 6/10 reflects that this model is above average in its approach and execution, but still has significant uncertainties that limit its predictive power. It provides valuable insights for comparing intervention strategies, but its quantitative results should be interpreted cautiously.

### Model Quality (20%): 8.00/10

**Final Score**: 6.47/10

### Surprise (40%): 7.00/10

#### Run 1:

I would rate this model as a 7 out of 10 on the surprising scale for members of the rationalist and effective altruism communities. Here's my reasoning:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The finding that intense mental effort requires less metabolic energy than a simple physical action like scratching one's nose contradicts common intuitions about mental exertion. Many people, even in these communities, might assume that challenging cognitive tasks are metabolically costly.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The idea that the brain's energy consumption doesn't significantly increase during intense mental activity is non-obvious. It challenges the common perception that mental fatigue is directly related to energy expenditure.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: While not entirely new information, this model highlights an often overlooked aspect of brain function - its relatively constant energy consumption regardless of mental activity. This could lead to new insights about the nature of mental fatigue and cognitive effort.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The difference between the energy expended in intense thinking (<<5 J) and a simple physical action like scratching one's nose (>3.2 J) is significant and unexpected.

Specific details that illustrate the surprising aspects:

1. The fact that whole brain changes in blood flow and metabolism during intense mental activity are undetectable is counterintuitive and challenges common assumptions.

2. The separation of mental fatigue from physical fatigue into two distinct mechanisms ("innate drive to minimize voluntary attention control" vs. "innate drive to minimize voluntary motor control") provides a novel framework for understanding cognitive effort.

3. The quantitative comparison between mental and physical tasks is striking - the idea that scratching one's nose requires more energy than intense thinking for five seconds is likely to be surprising to many.

While these findings might not be entirely new to neuroscientists, they are likely to challenge the intuitions of many in the rationalist and EA communities, hence the relatively high surprise rating of 7/10. The model provides a quantitative basis for understanding the energy costs of cognition, which could have implications for discussions about AI, consciousness, and cognitive enhancement within these communities.

---

#### Run 2:

To evaluate the surprisingness of this Fermi model, I'll consider the key aspects you outlined:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: This model challenges a common intuition that intense mental effort is energetically costly. Many people assume that mental fatigue is directly related to energy expenditure, similar to physical fatigue.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The finding that scratching one's nose likely requires more energy than intense thinking for 5 seconds is non-obvious and reveals a hidden complexity in how we perceive mental vs. physical effort.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: While not entirely new information to neuroscientists, this model uncovers a generally unrecognized fact about the minimal energy costs of cognitive effort for the broader rationalist and EA communities.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The difference between the energy expenditure of intense thinking (<5 J) and a simple physical action like scratching one's nose (>3.2 J) is significant enough to be noteworthy, though not extreme.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The negligible change in whole-brain energy consumption during intense mental activity.
2. The comparison between mental and physical tasks, showing that a seemingly trivial physical action can require more energy than intense thinking.
3. The implication that mental fatigue is not primarily driven by energy conservation, but by other mechanisms (like the "innate drive to minimize voluntary attention control").

Rating: 7/10

This rating reflects that while the information isn't entirely novel in neuroscience, it's likely to be quite surprising to many in the rationalist and EA communities. The counterintuitive nature of the finding and its contradiction of common assumptions about mental effort make it notably surprising. However, it doesn't completely overturn major theories or reveal entirely unknown phenomena, which prevents it from scoring higher on the surprise scale.

---

#### Run 3:

I would rate this model and its findings as a 7 out of 10 on the surprising scale for members of the rationalist and effective altruism communities. Here's my reasoning:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The model challenges a common intuition that intense mental effort is energetically costly. Many people, even in rationalist circles, might assume that "thinking really hard" consumes significant energy, comparable to physical tasks. This finding contradicts that assumption.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The idea that scratching one's nose requires more energy than intense thought is non-obvious and reveals hidden complexities about brain function and energy expenditure.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: While not entirely new information, this model helps uncover and quantify the surprisingly low energy cost of mental effort, which might not have been widely recognized or appreciated within these communities.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The difference between the energy expenditure of intense thought (<<5 J) and a simple physical action like scratching one's nose (>3.2 J) is significant and likely larger than most would expect.

Specific aspects that contribute to the surprising nature of the findings:

1. The model suggests that the net extra primary metabolic energy expenditure for intense thinking might be zero, which is counterintuitive.

2. It highlights that attempts to measure whole brain changes in blood flow and metabolism during intense mental activity have failed to demonstrate any change, which challenges common assumptions about brain energy use.

3. The comparison to a simple physical action (scratching one's nose) provides a tangible and relatable reference point that emphasizes how little energy intense thinking actually requires.

4. The model supports the idea that mental fatigue is not directly related to energy expenditure, but rather to an "innate drive to minimize voluntary attention control," which is a nuanced perspective that many might not have considered.

While this information might not be entirely new to some experts in neuroscience or cognitive science, it's likely to be surprising and thought-provoking for many in the rationalist and EA communities. The quantification and clear comparison make the concept more concrete and impactful.

A rating of 7 reflects that while this information is quite surprising and counterintuitive, it's not completely revolutionary or paradigm-shifting for these communities, who are often exposed to counterintuitive scientific findings.

### Robustness (20%): 6.33/10

#### Run 1:

Evaluation of the Fermi model:

Score: 7/10

Justification:

This Fermi model is relatively robust, considering the factors you've outlined. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model makes conservative assumptions and uses upper bounds, which reduces sensitivity to specific parameter choices. For example, it assumes <<5% energy change for intense mental activity, which is likely an overestimate. This approach provides a margin of error that strengthens the conclusion.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model cites a peer-reviewed scientific paper (Raichle & Gusnard 2002) for its key data point on brain energy expenditure during mental activity. This lends credibility to the core assumption. However, the model could be strengthened by including more recent studies to confirm that this finding still holds.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model uses sound reasoning and appropriate methods for a Fermi estimation. It breaks down the problem into comparable units (Joules) and uses basic physics principles (e.g., mgh for potential energy) to estimate physical movement energy. The comparison between mental and physical activity is logical and well-structured.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   The underlying assumptions are likely to be well-accepted within the rationalist and EA communities. The idea that mental fatigue is distinct from physical fatigue aligns with current understanding in cognitive science and neurobiology.

Strengths:

- Conservative estimates and upper bounds
- Use of peer-reviewed scientific literature
- Clear, step-by-step reasoning
- Comparison of mental and physical activities in the same units

Weaknesses:

- Reliance on a single, somewhat dated study for brain energy expenditure
- Some simplifications in the physical movement calculations (e.g., not accounting for all muscle movements in nose-scratching)

The model scores above average (7/10) due to its methodological soundness, conservative approach, and grounding in scientific literature. However, it falls short of a higher score due to the reliance on a single study and some simplifications in the physical calculations. Nonetheless, the conclusion is likely robust to reasonable changes in assumptions, making it a solid Fermi estimation.

---

#### Run 2:

Thank you for sharing this interesting Fermi model comparing the energy expenditure of intense thinking versus scratching one's nose. I'll evaluate its robustness based on the criteria you outlined.

Robustness Score: 6/10

Justification:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model relies on several assumptions, but most are reasonably conservative. The key assumption of <<5% energy increase for intense thinking is based on published research, which adds credibility. The mechanical work calculation for lifting an arm is straightforward and based on basic physics. The 25% muscle efficiency is a reasonable estimate, though it could vary. Overall, the model's conclusions seem robust to small changes in these assumptions.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model cites a reputable scientific paper (Raichle & Gusnard 2002) for its core assumption about brain energy use. This strengthens the evidence base considerably. However, the model would be more robust if it included additional sources to corroborate these findings or to support other assumptions (e.g., muscle efficiency).

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The approach is logical and uses appropriate physical principles. The author acknowledges uncertainties and uses conservative estimates, which is good practice. The comparison between mental and physical tasks is creative and insightful. However, the model could be improved by more explicitly stating all assumptions and providing sensitivity analysis for key parameters.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   The underlying assumptions about brain energy use and basic physics are likely to be widely accepted in rationalist and EA communities. The idea that mental fatigue is not directly related to energy expenditure might be more controversial, but the author provides a link to a more detailed explanation of this concept.

Strengths:

- Uses published scientific research for key assumptions
- Employs basic physics principles correctly
- Acknowledges uncertainties and uses conservative estimates
- Provides an insightful comparison between mental and physical tasks

Weaknesses:

- Relies on a single source for brain energy use data
- Could benefit from more explicit statement of all assumptions
- Lacks sensitivity analysis for key parameters
- The conclusion about mental fatigue mechanisms is not fully explored in this model

In conclusion, while this model has some limitations, it provides a reasonable first-pass estimate and insight into the relative energy costs of mental versus physical tasks. Its use of published research and conservative estimates lends credibility to its conclusions. However, additional sources and more detailed sensitivity analysis would further increase its robustness. The score of 6/10 reflects a model that is above average in robustness but with room for improvement.

---

#### Run 3:

I'll evaluate this Fermi model based on the criteria provided:

Robustness Score: 6/10

Justification:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model relies on several assumptions, but most are reasonably conservative. The upper bound of 5% change in blood flow for intense mental activity is based on published research, which is a strength. The assumption that thinking hard is <<5% of total brain energy use seems reasonable but could be challenged. The physical calculations for scratching one's nose are based on basic physics principles, which are robust. However, the 25% muscle efficiency is an estimate that could vary.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model cites a credible scientific paper (Raichle & Gusnard 2002) for its key assumption about brain energy use. This strengthens the model's foundation. However, more recent studies could potentially provide updated or more precise figures. The physical calculations are based on well-established principles.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The approach is logical, comparing mental and physical energy expenditure. The author acknowledges uncertainties and uses conservative estimates (e.g., "<<5%"), which is good practice. The comparison method is appropriate for a Fermi estimation. However, the model could benefit from more explicit consideration of error margins.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   The basic premise that mental effort doesn't significantly increase overall brain energy use is likely to be accepted in rationalist circles, based on the cited research. The physical calculations are based on widely accepted principles. The distinction between mental and physical tiredness as separate mechanisms might be more controversial but is not central to the energy calculation.

Strengths:

- Use of published scientific research for key assumptions
- Conservative estimates and acknowledgment of uncertainties
- Logical comparison method
- Grounding in basic physical principles for the comparative calculation

Weaknesses:

- Some assumptions could benefit from more recent or comprehensive data
- Lack of explicit error analysis
- The 25% muscle efficiency figure could be better sourced or justified

Overall, this model presents a reasonable Fermi estimation that aligns with scientific understanding. It's not highly precise but provides a useful order-of-magnitude comparison. The approach is sound, and the key conclusion is likely robust to moderate changes in assumptions. The score of 6/10 reflects a model that is above average in robustness but leaves room for refinement and more comprehensive data support.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model doesn't uncover previously unrecognized issues, but it does provide a quantitative estimate for a metric (total AI research years) that isn't commonly discussed.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The range of the estimate (150k to 5.4M years, with a mean of 1.7M) is quite wide, which might be somewhat surprising in its breadth.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The sheer scale of the cumulative research years (mean 1.7M) might be higher than many would intuitively guess, considering AI as a relatively young field.

2. The model's estimate of modern growth rates (15% to 40% annually) might be higher than some would expect, even accounting for the recent AI boom.

3. The wide range of the estimate (150k to 5.4M years) demonstrates the high level of uncertainty in this area, which might be surprising to some who expect more precise figures.

However, these surprises are relatively mild. The model's overall structure and conclusions largely align with existing understanding within the rationalist and EA communities.

Rating: 4/10

This rating reflects that while the model provides some interesting quantitative insights, its overall conclusions and structure are not highly surprising to the target communities. The specific numbers generated might raise eyebrows, but the general trends and patterns align with existing knowledge. The model is more a useful quantification of existing understanding rather than a paradigm-shifting revelation.

---

#### Run 3:

To evaluate the surprising nature of this model's findings for the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider the key aspects you've outlined:

1. Contradiction of Expectations: The model doesn't significantly contradict widely held beliefs within these communities. The general trajectory of AI research growth, including the impact of AI winters and the recent acceleration, aligns with common understanding.

2. Counterintuitiveness: The model's results aren't particularly counterintuitive. The growth patterns and the impact of different eras on AI research are largely in line with what one might expect.

3. Discovery of Unknowns: The model doesn't uncover previously unrecognized issues or risks. It quantifies known trends rather than revealing new insights.

4. Magnitude of Difference: The scale of AI research years (150k to 5.4M years, mean 1.7M) might be larger than some would intuitively estimate, but it's not drastically different from what informed members of these communities might expect given the field's history.

Specific aspects that might be mildly surprising:

1. The wide range of the estimate (150k to 5.4M years) highlights the significant uncertainty in quantifying historical AI research efforts.

2. The mean of 1.7M research years is substantial and might be higher than some would casually estimate, potentially emphasizing the cumulative effort that has gone into AI research.

3. The model's growth rates, particularly for the modern era (15% to 40% annual growth), quantify the rapid expansion in a way that might be more precise than many people's informal estimates.

However, these aspects are not radically surprising for communities that closely follow AI development trends.

Given these considerations, I would rate the surprising nature of this model's findings as:

3 out of 10

This score reflects that while the model provides a valuable quantification of AI research efforts, its core findings and implications are largely in line with what informed members of the rationalist and effective altruism communities would expect. The model offers a more precise framework for thinking about AI research growth, but doesn't present information that would significantly challenge or alter existing views within these communities.

### Topic Relevance (20%): 7.33/10

#### Run 1:

To evaluate the importance of this Fermi model to the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider its relevance and impact potential.

Relevance: 8/10
This model directly addresses a key question in AI development and the scaling hypothesis, which are central topics in rationalist and EA discussions about transformative AI and existential risk. The model attempts to quantify the total amount of AI research conducted historically, which is relevant to debates about the pace of AI progress and the likelihood of突破性进展 (breakthrough progress).

1. Prioritization of AI safety research
2. Estimates of timelines to transformative AI
3. Debates about the efficacy of different AI development approaches

The model's findings (150k to 5.4M researcher-years) provide a concrete range that could be used in further analyses and decision-making within these communities.

Overall Score: 7.5/10

This score reflects that the model is significantly above the median importance (5/10) for these communities. It directly engages with core topics in AI development and provides quantitative estimates that could inform important discussions and decisions. However, it doesn't reach the highest levels of importance (9-10) as it doesn't directly address immediate action items or policy decisions, and its findings, while valuable, are one input among many in the complex landscape of AI progress estimation.

---

#### Run 2:

To evaluate the importance of this Fermi model to the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider its relevance and potential impact:

Reasoning:

- The model addresses highly relevant topics for the rationalist and EA communities, particularly in relation to AI development and its potential impacts.
- It provides a quantitative framework for understanding the progression of AI research, which can inform important discussions and decision-making.
- However, it doesn't directly address some of the most pressing questions in these communities (e.g., AI alignment, existential risk), which prevents it from scoring higher.
- The model's findings, while valuable, are unlikely to dramatically shift existing views or priorities within these communities, but they do provide useful context and data points for ongoing discussions.

A score of 7/10 indicates that this model is significantly above the median importance (5/10) for these communities, reflecting its high relevance and moderate to high potential impact on discussions and decision-making processes related to AI development and its implications.

### Robustness (20%): 7.00/10

#### Run 1:

Thank you for providing this detailed Fermi model for evaluation. I'll analyze its robustness based on the factors you've outlined and provide a numeric score with justification.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model is moderately sensitive to its key assumptions, particularly the initial number of researchers and growth rates for different periods. However, it uses ranges rather than point estimates for these key parameters, which helps to capture uncertainty. The use of normal distributions with increasing uncertainty over time is a reasonable approach to model the growing uncertainty in estimates as we move further from the present.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model uses some well-established historical points (like the Dartmouth conference and AI winters) as anchors. However, it doesn't cite specific sources for its growth rate estimates or the number of current AI researchers. The lack of explicit data sources for these key inputs somewhat weakens the evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates good methodological rigor in several ways:

- It breaks down the timeline into distinct periods with different growth characteristics.
- It incorporates uncertainty that increases with time distance from the present.
- It uses a combination of exponential growth and normal distributions to model researcher numbers.
- It includes tests to verify basic expectations about the model's behavior.

The approach of using Squiggle for probabilistic modeling is appropriate for this type of estimation.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   The general structure of the model (early slow growth, AI winters, and recent rapid growth) aligns well with the commonly accepted narrative in the AI and EA communities. The specific growth rates used seem plausible, though they might benefit from more explicit justification or sourcing.

5. Strengths:

- Incorporates historical events (AI winters) that affected the field's growth.
- Uses probabilistic distributions to capture uncertainty.
- Includes sensitivity analysis through varying growth rates.
- Provides clear documentation and explanation of assumptions.

6. Weaknesses:

- Lacks explicit sources for key input parameters.
- Assumes smooth transitions between periods, which may not reflect reality.
- Does not account for potential differences in research quality or impact over time.
- May underestimate the recent explosion in AI research, especially in industry settings.

Overall Rating: 7/10

Justification:
This model demonstrates strong methodological rigor and a good understanding of the historical context of AI research. It appropriately uses probabilistic methods to capture uncertainty and provides a plausible range of estimates. The inclusion of different growth periods and increasing uncertainty over time shows careful consideration of the problem's complexity.

However, the lack of explicit sources for key parameters and the potential underestimation of recent growth in AI research prevent it from scoring higher. The model could be improved by incorporating more recent data on AI research growth, especially from industry sources, and by providing more detailed justification for its growth rate assumptions.

The score of 7/10 reflects a model that is above average in its robustness, with clear strengths in its methodological approach and historical grounding, but with room for improvement in its data sourcing and recent trend capturing.

---

#### Run 2:

Thank you for providing this detailed Fermi model for evaluation. I'll assess its robustness based on the criteria you've outlined and provide a score with justification.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model is moderately sensitive to its key assumptions, particularly the initial number of researchers and growth rates for different periods. However, it uses reasonable ranges for these parameters, which helps mitigate this sensitivity. The use of different growth rates for various periods (early growth, AI winters, modern era) adds nuance to the model.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model uses some historical anchors (e.g., Dartmouth conference, AI winters) which provide a good foundation. However, it doesn't cite specific sources for its growth rate estimates or researcher numbers, which somewhat weakens its evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates good methodological rigor. It uses a time-based approach, accounting for different growth periods and incorporating uncertainty that varies with time. The use of normal distributions for uncertainty and the implementation of different growth modes for AI winters show thoughtful modeling.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   The general structure of the model (initial small field, periods of growth and decline, rapid modern growth) aligns well with commonly accepted narratives in the AI and EA communities. The specific growth rates used seem reasonable but might benefit from more explicit justification.

5. Additional Strengths:

- The model includes tests to verify basic expectations (e.g., growth in modern era, decrease during AI winter).
- It provides a clear summary of assumptions, key findings, and caveats.
- The use of uncertainty that increases with time from the start year is a sophisticated touch.

6. Areas for Improvement:

- More explicit sourcing for growth rates and initial researcher numbers would strengthen the model.
- Consideration of geographic variations in AI research growth could add depth.
- The model could potentially benefit from incorporating major funding or policy shifts that affected AI research.

Overall Score: 7/10

Justification:
This model demonstrates strong methodological rigor and a good understanding of the historical context of AI research. Its use of varying growth rates and time-dependent uncertainty shows sophisticated modeling techniques. The inclusion of tests and a detailed summary with caveats indicates a thoughtful approach.

However, the lack of explicit sources for key parameters and the potential underestimation of informal or independent researchers slightly reduce its robustness. The model also doesn't account for geographic variations, which could be significant given the global nature of AI research.

Despite these limitations, the model provides a reasonable and well-structured estimate of AI research years. Its approach of using different growth modes for various periods, including AI winters, adds credibility to the results. The final estimate range (150k to 5.4M years, with a mean of 1.7M) seems plausible given the history of the field.

In the context of evaluating models on a curve where 5 is median expectation, this model scores above average due to its methodological strengths and thoughtful approach to modeling uncertainty and historical trends.

---

#### Run 3:

Thank you for providing this detailed Fermi model for evaluating the cumulative AI research years. I'll analyze the model based on the factors you've outlined and provide a numeric score for its robustness.

Evaluation:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model is moderately sensitive to its key assumptions, particularly the growth rates for different periods and the initial number of researchers. However, it attempts to mitigate this sensitivity by using ranges for these values rather than point estimates. The use of normal distributions with increasing uncertainty over time also helps to account for the growing unpredictability in later years.

2. Evidence Base:
   The model uses some historical anchors (like the Dartmouth conference) and generally accepted periods (AI winters, deep learning revolution) as its foundation. While these are credible starting points, the model could benefit from more explicit citations or references to support its growth rate assumptions and researcher numbers.

3. Methodological Rigor:
   The model demonstrates good methodological rigor in several ways:

- It breaks down the timeline into distinct periods with different growth characteristics.
- It incorporates uncertainty that increases over time.
- It uses Monte Carlo simulation (implicit in Squiggle) to propagate uncertainty.
- It includes tests to verify expected behaviors (e.g., decrease during AI winters, increase in modern era).

4. Consensus of Assumptions:
   The general structure of the model (early growth, AI winters, modern acceleration) aligns well with commonly accepted narratives in the AI and EA communities. The specific growth rates used seem plausible, though they might benefit from more explicit justification.

Strengths:

- Comprehensive timeline covering key periods in AI research history
- Incorporation of uncertainty and variability in growth rates
- Use of tests to validate model behavior
- Consideration of different growth modes during AI winters

Weaknesses:

- Lack of explicit sources for some key assumptions
- Potential oversimplification of researcher growth (e.g., not accounting for geographic variations or different types of AI research, as noted in the caveats)
- Uncertainty in defining what constitutes an "AI researcher" over time

Overall Rating: 7/10

Justification:
The model demonstrates strong methodological rigor and aligns well with commonly accepted narratives in the field. It makes a genuine effort to incorporate uncertainty and variable growth rates, which adds to its robustness. The inclusion of tests and detailed caveats shows a thoughtful approach to model construction.

However, it falls short of a higher score due to the lack of explicit sources for some key assumptions and the potential oversimplification of researcher growth patterns. While the model acknowledges these limitations in its caveats, addressing them more directly in the model structure could further improve its robustness.

The final estimate of 150k to 5.4M cumulative AI research years (with a mean of 1.7M) seems plausible given the model's structure, but the wide range reflects the significant uncertainty inherent in such a long-term estimation.

In conclusion, while there's room for improvement, this model represents a well-constructed attempt at quantifying cumulative AI research effort, placing it above the median expectation in terms of robustness.

**Final Score**: 5.53/10

### Surprise (40%): 7.00/10

#### Run 1:

Let's evaluate this Fermi model based on the criteria provided:

Surprise Rating: 7/10

Rationale:

1. Contradiction of Expectations:
   The model challenges the common perception of the scale of AI investments by comparing it to a massive physical feat. This comparison is not something that would typically come to mind when thinking about AI infrastructure spending.

2. Counterintuitiveness:
   The idea of moving a mountain across an ocean as an equivalent to AI investment is highly counterintuitive. It provides a tangible, physical representation of an abstract financial concept, which is not immediately obvious.

3. Discovery of Unknowns:
   While the model doesn't necessarily uncover new risks or opportunities, it does provide a novel way of conceptualizing the scale of AI investments. This could lead to new perspectives on resource allocation and the magnitude of current AI efforts.

4. Magnitude of Difference:
   The sheer scale of the physical feat described (moving a 2-mile high mountain across the Atlantic) is significantly different from how most people would conceptualize $500 billion in AI infrastructure investment.

Specific details that illustrate the surprising aspects:

1. The conversion of a financial figure into a physical, geological task is unexpected and eye-opening.
2. The calculation involves cross-disciplinary concepts (shipping costs, rock density, angle of repose) that are not typically associated with AI investments.
3. The humorous touch of placing the mountain in Kansas to address the "flatter than a pancake" joke adds an element of surprise and engagement.
4. The model provides a concrete visualization of an abstract concept, which could be particularly impactful for those who struggle to conceptualize large financial figures.

This model is rated as a 7/10 on the surprise scale because while it doesn't completely overturn established beliefs within the rationalist and EA communities, it does present the information in a highly unexpected and memorable way. It challenges the abstract nature of financial discussions by grounding them in a physical, albeit hypothetical, scenario. This approach could lead to new ways of thinking about and communicating the scale of investments and efforts in various fields, not just AI.

---

#### Run 2:

Let's evaluate this Fermi model based on the given criteria:

Surprising Score: 7/10

Reasoning:

1. Contradiction of Expectations:
   The model challenges the conventional thinking about the scale and potential of AI investments by comparing it to a massive physical feat. This comparison is likely to be unexpected for most members of the rationalist and EA communities, who typically focus on abstract or technological implications of such investments.

2. Counterintuitiveness:
   The idea of moving a mountain across an ocean is inherently counterintuitive, especially when framed as an alternative use of AI investment funds. This comparison reveals the immense scale of the investment in a tangible, physical way that might not be immediately apparent when thinking about technological infrastructure.

3. Discovery of Unknowns:
   While not necessarily uncovering new risks or opportunities, the model does highlight the sheer magnitude of the investment in a novel way. It may prompt community members to reconsider the scale of resources being directed towards AI and potential alternative uses of such funds.

4. Magnitude of Difference:
   The comparison is quite striking. Moving a mountain across an ocean is so far removed from typical discussions about AI investments that it creates a significant cognitive dissonance, which contributes to its surprising nature.

Specific details that illustrate the surprising aspects:

1. The conversion of a $500 billion investment into 50 billion tons of movable material provides a tangible sense of scale that's not typically associated with discussions of AI infrastructure.

2. The calculation of the mountain's height (approximately 2 miles) when placed in Kansas adds a vivid, geographically specific element that makes the comparison more concrete and surprising.

3. The use of shipping costs and geological concepts (like angle of repose) to frame an AI investment is an unexpected approach that bridges disparate fields of knowledge.

The score of 7/10 reflects that while the comparison is indeed quite surprising and offers a novel perspective, it doesn't fundamentally alter our understanding of AI investments or reveal critical new information. However, it does provide a striking and memorable way to conceptualize the scale of these investments, which is likely to be notably surprising to many in the rationalist and EA communities who are accustomed to thinking about AI investments in more abstract or technological terms.

---

#### Run 3:

Let's evaluate this Fermi model based on the criteria provided:

Contradiction of Expectations: 7/10
This model challenges the common perception of the scale and potential impact of AI infrastructure investments by comparing it to a massive physical feat. Many in the rationalist and EA communities might expect such investments to be primarily abstract or digital, not comparable to moving mountains.

Counterintuitiveness: 8/10
The comparison between AI investment and moving a mountain across an ocean is highly non-obvious. It reveals a hidden complexity in understanding the scale of large financial investments by translating them into physical terms.

Discovery of Unknowns: 6/10
While not uncovering new risks or opportunities directly, this model provides a novel way to conceptualize the scale of AI investments. It might prompt people to think about the physical world implications and resource allocation of such large-scale tech investments.

Magnitude of Difference: 7/10
The scale of the physical feat described (moving a mountain across an ocean) is significantly different from how most people would typically conceive of a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.

Specific surprising aspects:

1. The sheer scale of the physical equivalent (a mountain 1-2 miles high) to the AI investment.
2. The feasibility of such a massive physical undertaking with the same amount of money as the AI investment.
3. The use of shipping costs as a baseline for comparison, linking digital infrastructure to physical logistics.
4. The potential impact on geography (e.g., changing the landscape of Kansas) as a metaphor for AI's impact.

Overall Score: 7/10

This Fermi model is quite surprising in its approach and conclusions. It takes a highly abstract concept (AI infrastructure investment) and translates it into a concrete, physical scenario that's easier to visualize and comprehend. This translation is likely to be eye-opening for many in the rationalist and EA communities, as it provides a new perspective on the scale of tech investments. The comparison to moving a mountain across an ocean is both memorable and thought-provoking, potentially sparking new discussions about resource allocation and the tangible impacts of large-scale tech investments.

### Topic Relevance (20%): 2.17/10

#### Run 1:

To evaluate this Fermi model's importance to the rationalist and effective altruism communities, let's consider its relevance and impact potential:

Relevance: 3/10
The model compares the scale of AI infrastructure investment to a hypothetical mountain-moving project. While it does touch on AI, which is a topic of interest to these communities, the comparison itself doesn't directly address core issues or challenges faced by rationalists or effective altruists. The model is more of a creative thought experiment than a practical analysis of AI impacts or resource allocation.

Impact Potential: 2/10
The findings of this model are unlikely to significantly influence decision-making, policy, or priority-setting within these communities. While it provides an interesting perspective on the scale of AI investment, it doesn't offer actionable insights or address key questions about AI development, risks, or potential benefits that would typically guide these communities' thinking and strategies.

Overall Score: 2/10

This score reflects that while the model touches on AI, a relevant topic, its approach and findings are not particularly aligned with the practical, impact-focused interests of the rationalist and effective altruism communities. The model is more of an entertaining thought experiment than a tool for guiding important decisions or understanding crucial issues in AI development and its societal impacts.

A median expectation (5/10) would be a model that more directly addresses questions about AI safety, capability development timelines, or potential societal impacts of large-scale AI investments. This model, while creative, falls below that median in terms of its direct relevance and potential to inform important decisions within these communities.

To evaluate this Fermi model's importance to the rationalist and effective altruism communities, I'll consider its relevance and impact potential:

Relevance: 3/10

- The model compares AI infrastructure investment to moving a mountain, which is not directly related to core rationalist or EA concerns.
- It does touch on AI development, a topic of interest, but only tangentially through the investment amount.
- The comparison doesn't provide insight into AI safety, existential risk, or other key EA topics.

Impact Potential: 2/10

- The model is unlikely to influence decision-making or priority-setting within these communities.
- It doesn't provide actionable information or new perspectives on AI development or resource allocation.
- The comparison, while interesting, doesn't offer practical utility for policy or strategy discussions.

Overall Score: 2.5/10

This score reflects that while the model touches on AI investment, a topic of interest to these communities, its framing and content don't significantly contribute to core rationalist or EA discussions. The mountain-moving analogy, while creative, doesn't provide substantial insights that would impact decision-making or priorities within these communities. It's more of a curiosity than a tool for advancing important discussions or analyses in rationalist or EA circles.

---

#### Run 3:

To evaluate this Fermi model's importance to the rationalist and effective altruism communities, let's consider its relevance and impact potential:

Relevance: 3/10
The model compares the scale of AI infrastructure investment to a hypothetical geological engineering project. While it provides an interesting perspective on the magnitude of the investment, it doesn't directly address core issues in rationalism or effective altruism. The AI investment itself is relevant, but the comparison to moving mountains is more of a curiosity than a central concern.

Impact Potential: 2/10
The model's findings are unlikely to significantly influence decision-making or priority-setting within these communities. While it might serve as an attention-grabbing illustration of the scale of AI investments, it doesn't provide actionable insights for policy or resource allocation in areas typically prioritized by rationalists or effective altruists.

Overall Score: 2/10

This score reflects that while the model touches on AI investments (a topic of interest), its framing and conclusions are not particularly aligned with the goals and methodologies of the rationalist and EA communities. It's more of an interesting thought experiment than a model that would drive meaningful discussions or decisions in these circles.

The low score also takes into account that many other Fermi models would likely be much more directly relevant and impactful for these communities, such as those addressing existential risks, global poverty alleviation, or the direct impacts of AI development on society.

### Robustness (20%): 5.33/10

#### Run 1:

Let's evaluate this Fermi model based on the given criteria:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions: 6/10
   The model relies on several assumptions, but most are reasonably well-grounded. The cost of shipping dry bulk cargo and rock density are within typical ranges. The angle of repose assumption is also reasonable for most rock types. However, the model is sensitive to these inputs, and small changes could affect the final height estimate.

2. Evidence Base: 5/10
   The model uses generally accepted figures for shipping costs and rock properties. However, it doesn't cite specific sources for these figures, which would have strengthened the evidence base. The use of Kansas as a reference point is arbitrary but doesn't significantly impact the overall conclusion.

3. Methodological Rigor: 7/10
   The calculation method is sound, using appropriate geometric formulas and considering relevant factors like rock density and angle of repose. The step-by-step approach shows clear reasoning. However, the model simplifies some aspects, such as assuming uniform costs regardless of distance or scale, which might not hold true for such a massive project.

4. Consensus of Assumptions: 6/10
   Most of the assumptions used in this model would likely be accepted within the rationalist and EA communities as reasonable approximations. The use of Fermi estimation techniques to tackle large-scale questions is common in these circles. However, some might question the relevance or practicality of the comparison between AI infrastructure investment and mountain relocation.

Overall Score: 6/10

Justification:
This Fermi model demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant factors and uses appropriate mathematical techniques to arrive at its conclusion. The step-by-step approach and consideration of physical properties like rock density and angle of repose add to its credibility.

However, there are some limitations. The model doesn't account for potential economies or diseconomies of scale in such a massive project, nor does it consider practical challenges of such an endeavor (e.g., environmental impacts, logistical constraints). The comparison between AI infrastructure investment and mountain relocation, while interesting, may not provide actionable insights.

The model's strength lies in its clear reasoning and use of plausible figures, but it could be improved by citing sources for its assumptions and considering more real-world complications. It serves well as a back-of-the-envelope calculation but shouldn't be taken as a precise estimate.

Given these factors, a score of 6/10 seems appropriate. It's above average in its methodological approach and reasoning, but there's room for improvement in terms of evidence base and consideration of real-world complexities.

---

#### Run 2:

Let's evaluate this Fermi model based on the given criteria:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions: 6/10
   The model makes several assumptions, but most are within reasonable ranges. The cost of shipping, rock density, and angle of repose are all plausible estimates. However, the model is sensitive to these assumptions, and small changes could affect the final result significantly.

2. Evidence Base: 5/10
   The model uses some factual data, such as the cost of shipping dry bulk cargo and typical angles of repose for loose materials. However, it doesn't cite specific sources for these figures, which would have strengthened the evidence base.

3. Methodological Rigor: 7/10
   The calculation method is sound and follows logical steps. It uses appropriate formulas (volume of a cone) and considers relevant factors (angle of repose). The model also acknowledges variations in some parameters (rock density, angle of repose) by providing ranges.

4. Consensus of Assumptions: 6/10
   Most of the assumptions used in this model would likely be accepted within the rationalist and EA communities as reasonable approximations. The use of shipping costs and basic geometric principles aligns with common approaches to Fermi estimations.

Overall Score: 6/10

Justification:
This Fermi model demonstrates a reasonably robust approach to estimating the size of a mountain that could be moved with a large investment. Its strengths lie in its methodological rigor and use of plausible assumptions.

The model uses a logical sequence of calculations, starting from the cost of shipping to determine the volume of material that could be moved, and then uses geometric principles to estimate the height of the resulting mountain. This approach shows good problem-solving skills and an understanding of relevant physical concepts.

However, there are some areas where the model could be improved:

1. The model doesn't account for the full costs involved in such an operation. Shipping is only one part of the process; excavation, loading, unloading, and land acquisition costs are not considered.

2. The assumption that all of the $500 billion would go directly to shipping costs is an oversimplification that likely overestimates the amount of material that could be moved.

3. The model doesn't consider practical limitations such as the availability of ships, port capacities, or the time such an operation would take.

4. While the use of ranges for some parameters (rock density, angle of repose) is good, a more robust model might have used these to provide a range of possible outcomes rather than a single estimate.

5. The lack of cited sources for the figures used (shipping costs, rock densities) somewhat weakens the model's credibility.

Despite these limitations, the model provides a reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate and demonstrates good use of Fermi estimation techniques. It's more robust than a median expectation (which would score a 5), hence the score of 6/10.

The acknowledgment that the model was developed with AI assistance (DeepSeek) is appreciated, as it adds transparency to the process.

#### Run 3:

Evaluation of the Fermi Model:

Score: 4/10

Justification:

1. Sensitivity to Assumptions:
   The model is highly sensitive to several key assumptions, which significantly impacts its robustness:

   - The cost of shipping dry bulk cargo ($10 per ton) is a critical input that could vary widely depending on factors like distance, fuel costs, and market conditions.
   - The rock density assumption (2.5-3) is reasonable but could vary based on the type of rock considered.
   - The angle of repose (35°-45°) is a significant factor in determining the height of the mountain, and small changes here could lead to large differences in the final result.

2. Evidence Base:

   - The model lacks citations for its key data points, such as shipping costs and rock densities.
   - While the general approach uses known formulas (e.g., volume of a cone), the specific values used are not linked to authoritative sources.
   - The comparison to the $500 billion AI infrastructure investment is not substantiated or explained in detail.

3. Methodological Rigor:

   - The model uses basic geometric principles correctly, which is a strength.
   - However, it oversimplifies the complex logistics of such a massive operation. Factors like environmental impact, engineering challenges, and time constraints are not considered.
   - The model doesn't account for the variability in shipping costs over such a large-scale operation or the potential for economies (or diseconomies) of scale.

4. Consensus of Assumptions:

   - The basic physical and mathematical principles used would likely be accepted within the rationalist and EA communities.
   - However, the oversimplification and lack of consideration for real-world complexities might be seen as problematic.
   - The comparison to AI infrastructure investment seems arbitrary and might not align with how these communities typically evaluate such investments.

5. Additional Considerations:
   - The model doesn't address the feasibility or purpose of such an operation, which limits its practical value.
   - The conclusion about placing the mountain in Kansas seems arbitrary and detracts from the model's seriousness.

In conclusion, while the model uses some sound basic principles, its high sensitivity to assumptions, lack of cited evidence, oversimplification of a complex operation, and arbitrary comparisons significantly reduce its robustness. The score of 4/10 reflects that while it's an interesting thought experiment, it falls below the median expectation for a robust Fermi estimation in terms of practical applicability and rigorous analysis.
